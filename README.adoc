Tucker's Dotfiles
=================

These dotfiles are here mostly to move them between my computers and 
as a backup, but feel free to use them yourself.

Vim Plugins
-----------
I keep my vim plugins as submodules in this repo, I use
`github.com/tuckerevans/plugVim <https://www.github.com/tuckerevans/plugvim>`_
to manage them.


Installation
------------

dotfiles
~~~~~~~~

NOTE: I recommend backing up any existing dotfiles you have before
      installing these, you can do this with the following command
     `cp .dotfile_to_backup .dotfile_to_backup.bak`

Running `make process` should run the necessary files through m4 and compile my
input program for lemonbar.

I recomend using https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/[`stow`] to
manage these files. `make stow` should stow all of these dotfiles.
This can be also be done with the following command.

`stow [program]` for each program's dotfiles you want to use

====
Example: `stow vim` or `stow mutt`
